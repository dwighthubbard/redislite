# Reporting Problems

If you've found a bug in Redislite. You'll need to create a (free) GitHub 
account in order to submit an issue, to comment on them or to create pull 
requests.

## Using the issue tracker (Reporting an Issues)

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](https://github.com/yahoo/redislite/issues),
[features requests](https://github.com/yahoo/redislite/issues) and submitting 
pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or [IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23redislite&uio=d4)).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.

4. **Write a good bug report***

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. 

Try and include the following information:

* What is your environment?
* If the redislite package is installed, run "python -m redislite.debug" and paste the output into the issue.
* What steps will reproduce the issue?
* What were you expecting to happen?
* If the redislite python module installed, include the output of the debug module, which can be obtained by running:
    python -m redislite.debug
